Capture & store lead information, gather critical lead intelligence, manage web leads from within your site and close more deals.

== Description ==

> WordPress Leads works as a standalone plugin or hand in hand with [WordPress Landing Pages](http://wordpress.org/plugins/landing-pages/ "Learn more about WordPress Landing Pages") & [WordPress Calls to Action](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cta/ "Learn more about Calls to Action") to create a powerful & free lead generation system for your business.

Wordpress Leads is Wordpress's first fully extendable plugin for local CRM (Customer Relationship Management). Lead Management Plugin listens for form submissions & collects & stores visitor data into Wordpress as well as provides a record management interface for viewing and editing lead data.

Learn where your leads are converting from geographically, what pages they viewed before filling out your form, quickly view any past website conversions or notes and use this information to sell more effectively.

Wordpress Leads was originally built as an add-on for WordPress Landing Pages but also can be used as a stand alone plugin to capture lead information on non wordpress landing pages.

Lead Management makes use of the Wordpress Core Custom Post Type API as well as stored funnel conversion data for each form a user submits his information through. Lead Management also makes use of geolocation services to automatically detect location details about a customer upon first conversion. Lead data can be managed, altered, and updated from a CPT management area.

This plugin is built to be fully extendable by providing custom action and filter hooks, allowing for an almost endless number of powerful CRM application addons.
